1. Learn to git commit
2. Learning to ignore files in our commint
3. Added a file Licence to folder but not for the packaging stage
   This will give us a a message saying licence is ignored and TODO will be updated
   with corrected changes.
4. Learning to Ignore files completely from the project
   For example all the Files in tmp/* since we don't want git to check for them anyhow

5. Learning About Branch by creating a experimental branch
